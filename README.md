# Sightstone

Sightstone is a project that notifies you when a friend comes online. Sightstone utilizes the League Client Update (LCU) API to determine the status of friends.

## Scenario

You open League of Legends and none of your friends are online. You minimize the client and start watching Youtube videos. However, every 5 seconds you feel the urge to check if anyone is now online. With Sightstone, problem solved!

## How it works

By default all friends in the "General" friend group will be monitored. To monitor specific friends, create a friend group in the client called "Sightstone".
